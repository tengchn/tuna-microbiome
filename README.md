# Scripts for the analysis of tuna microbiome
This script is for the the paper "Trujillo-Gonz√°lez A, Li T, Potts J, Nicol S, Allain V, Godwin S, et al. Can Stomach Content and Microbiomes of Tuna Provide Near Real-Time Detection of Ecosystem Composition in the Pacific Ocean? Frontiers in Marine Science, 2022, 9: 811532."

Each folder contains the scripts for the analysis of three different sequencing libraries (MiFish, Ceph_Crust, and Prokaryote) in this paper (doi:). 

* For Prokaryote, the analysis was performed using the QIIME2 (Bolyen et al., 2019). 
* For MiFish, Ceph and Crust, the analyses were performed using the modified MiFish pipeline (Sato et al., 2018).
