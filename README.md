# Scripts for the analysis of tuna microbiome
Each folder contains the scripts for the analysis of three different microbiome sequencing libraries (MiFish, Ceph_Crust, and Prokaryote) in this paper (doi:). 
For Prokaryote, the analysis was performed using the QIIME2 (Bolyen et al., 2019). For MiFish, Ceph and Crust, the analyses were performed using the modified MiFish pipeline (Sato et al., 2018).
